# Definition of Done

## ⚠️ Core Principles
- **Test First**: Proceed to next step only after tests pass. Coverage 80%+ (each Phase), 90%+ (final)
- **Backend API First**: Implement API first → Swagger UI test → Frontend development
- **Document Immediately**: Update related documents immediately when requirements change

## Completion Criteria
